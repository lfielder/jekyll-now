<p>
	This is a long-term (3-5 year) project with the goal to revolutionize the way we provide support to our customers. We want to become more consistent and bring together the end-to-end experiences for all customers. </p><p>I was responsible for making interaction and usability decisions for the MVP as well as subsequent release phases that would introduce the UI to additional users and have unique requirements. I worked very closely with Dev to ensure all legacy features are accounted for, but also to ensure that any adjustments we could make to these features would add value to customers. 
</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
	We had many research sessions with customers that included both user interviews and usability studies. </p> <p>The user interviews were focused on some of the new classifications, statuses, and severities we were introducing with the new UI. We were able to solve a business request to provide customers a more descriptive and consistent set of severities, classifications, and categories when creating support tickets, which allowed our teams to prioritize work more accurately. 
</p>
<p>
	The usability studies focused on the new side-by-side layout, responsive layout options, and the new create ticket flow. We were also introducing new features for users that other systems provided like favoriting tickets. We wanted to understand how new users would adopt this feature. 
</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>
	We started the design process with a future vision session with product management, dev leads, and myself. During these sessions we leveraged previous research and business needs to make intial decisions about our long term plan for what we termed the "Support Platform". We new that the long term goal of this project was to revolutionize the way we deliver support to customers and increase their visibility for the work we perform for them.
</p>
<h4>Kickoff</h4>
<p>
	As with most successful projects, we held a kickoff week that included lead dev, product management, and design. It also includes multiple check-ins with project sponsors and key stakeholders. During the kickoff we established key milestones as well as the long term north-star vision for where this project could go.
</p>
<p>
	We have found that developing a north star vision is very helpful when describing things to key business stakeholders to provide them with an idea of where we are headed. It also helps align design and dev about how decisions now will impact the future. The other key thing about north star is that it isn't nailed down 100%. It is a little fuzzy, but does provide guidance. 
</p>
<h4>Milestone 1 - MVP</h4>

<p>
	Our MVP was initially focused on our dedicated hosting customers, but was switched to our public cloud customers due to requests from key customers and prospects. During this MVP phase we were able to introduce the side-by-side layout, create ticket flow, classifications, categorization, and severity. They big key feature for these users, and the main reason they were selected for our MVP release, was the need to create support tickets on specific sub-accounts that previously were not able to be associated with the tickets. This increased support productivity and customer confidence that their issue would be focused on the right infrastructure.

<h4>Milestone 2 - Dedicated Hosting Release</h4>
<p>
	The dedicated hosting release increased complexity significantly. It introduced additional feature previously not available to cloud users like ticket favoriting and ticket templates. It also required us to adhear to one-off decisions made by the previous ticketing portal. Specific routing logic for specific customers and even specific features for specific customers. The experience on the surface was very similar, the work to accomplish this was anything but easy. 
</p>
<p>
	I was able to work very closely with our API team to develop APIs that would accomodate current features, but be scalable for the future.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	This was one of the most complex project I have worked on. Due to resource contstraints and work force reductions, I was required to work on this as the lone designer for the vast majority of the project. While I was able to collaborate and get feedback from other designers, the context and background information required to make informed design decisions hindered my ability to do this as often as I would have liked. This project did provide me the ability to learn about integrating legacy systems and provide guidance for other teams that are undertaking similar goals.
