Welcome!</h2>

My name is Lane Fielder. I am a Lead UX Designer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>. I have had the opportunity to work across many different types of interfaces including e-commerce, public facing control surfaces, and internal systems. I have led other designers and also worked as a solo designer with a development team. I enjoy collaborating with product managers, development leaders, and key staokeholders to ensure we focus on user needs and business goals.</p>
