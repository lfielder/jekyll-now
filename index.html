<h2>
Welcome!</h2>
<p>
My name is Lane Fielder. I am a UX Designer at <a target="_blank" href="www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>. I have had the opportunity to work across many different types of interfaces including ecommerce, public facing control surfaces, and internal systems. I have led other designers and also worked as a solo designer with a development team. I enjoy collaborating with product managers and ensuring we are focused on both business goals and user goals.</p><p>

To me, design is about complex problem solving. I specialize in breaking down difficult problems and coming up with testable solutions.</p><p> If you are looking for a lead UX designer, please feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>My design process is adaptable, but at a high level I like to ensure that stakeholders and project teammates are aware of what to expect and how each phase inform and leads to the next phase. I bring along dev, product, and business stakeholders with this entire process.</p>
