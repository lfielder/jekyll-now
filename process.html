<h1>Design Process</h1>
<p>My design process is adaptable, but at a high level I like to ensure that stakeholders and project teammates are aware of what to expect and how each phase informs and leads to the next phase. I bring along dev, product, and business stakeholders with this entire process to ensure transparency across the team and expectations are met.</p>
